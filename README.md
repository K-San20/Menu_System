# Menu_System
Small mock up menu system made for a data structures project. Uses a singly linked list to manage the menu items.

!!DON'T RESIZE WINDOW!!

Use UP/DOWN arrow keys to navigate menu items and ENTER to select them.

ConsoleFunctions.h/.cpp only code provided to me, rest written solely by myself.

KNOWN ISSUE: Memory leaks when program is forcefully closed and not by using the "Exit" option from the main menu.
